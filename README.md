# Card Jitsu
This is a minimal recreation of the Card Jitsu mini-game from Club Penguin. This repo contains the front-end code built using React.
The back-end is in a separate repo (which is written in Rust using `warp` and Tokio), which exposes a web socket and handles all
game state.

The current version of the game is hosted on Vercel, which is in the repo's description.
